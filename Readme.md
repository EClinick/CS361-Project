## Testing Task Filter Service

### Overview

This section outlines the testing strategy for the **Task Filter Service** (`task_filter.py`). The tests are designed to validate the functionality of filtering tasks and managing user filter preferences. The **Task Stats Service** (`task_stats.py`) is included to provide task data for the tests.

### Why include Task Stats Service in the testing of Task Filter Service?

Even though our primary goal is to test the **Task Filter Service**, the **Task Stats Service** plays a crucial role in providing the underlying task data. The **Task Filter Service** filters tasks based on criteria such as priority, completion status, and due date. To perform these filtering operations effectively, the service requires a set of tasks to work with. The **Task Stats Service** facilitates this by allowing the creation, retrieval, and deletion of tasks, which are used as test data for the filter tests. Without the **Task Stats Service**, setting up and tearing down test data would be cumbersome and less efficient.

### Test Cases Overview

#### 1. Service Validation
- **Purpose:** Ensure both services are running and accessible.
- **Endpoints Tested:**
  - `GET /filter_tasks` (Task Filter Service)
  - `GET /view_tasks` (Task Stats Service)

#### 2. Setting Up Test Data
- **Purpose:** Create test tasks to validate filtering capabilities.
- **Tasks Created:**
  - High Priority Complete Task
  - High Priority Pending Task  
  - Low Priority Pending Task

#### 3. Testing Filter Tasks Endpoint
- **Purpose:** Validate the filtering functionality based on different criteria.
- **Test Cases:**
  - Filter by Priority (High): Should return 2 high-priority tasks.
  - Filter Completed Tasks: Should return 1 completed task.
  - Filter by Due Date (Today): Should return 2 tasks due today.

#### 4. Testing Preferences Endpoints
- **Purpose:** Verify saving, retrieving, and clearing filter preferences.
- **Test Cases:**
  - Save Preferences: Save filter settings successfully.
  - Get Saved Preferences: Retrieve saved preferences accurately.
  - Clear Preferences: Clear all saved preferences.

#### 5. Cleaning Up Test Data
- **Purpose:** Remove all test tasks created during the setup phase.
- **Process:** Retrieve and delete all test tasks.

### Running the Tests

1. Ensure Services are Running:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

2. Navigate to the Test Directory:
   ```bash
   cd test
   ```

3. Run the Test Script:
   ```bash
   python testing_task_filter.py
   ```

4. Review the Output: The script will display the progress and results of each test case.

### Conclusion

The comprehensive testing of the **Task Filter Service** ensures that filtering functionalities and preference management operate as expected. Including the **Task Stats Service** in the testing process is crucial for managing the necessary task data, thereby facilitating accurate and reliable test outcomes.

## Task Filter Service Communication Contract

### Requesting Data
The Task Filter Service accepts HTTP GET requests to filter tasks based on various criteria. You can request filtered tasks by making a GET request to the `/filter_tasks` endpoint with optional query parameters.

#### Example Request:
```python
import requests

# Example 1: Filter by priority
response = requests.get("http://task_filter:5003/filter_tasks?priority=high")

# Example 2: Filter by multiple criteria
response = requests.get("http://task_filter:5003/filter_tasks?priority=high&completed=true&due_date=2024-03-20")

# Available query parameters:
# - priority: 'low', 'medium', 'high'
# - completed: 'true', 'false'
# - due_date: 'YYYY-MM-DD'
```

### Receiving Data
The service returns data in JSON format. The response will contain a list of filtered tasks under the key "filtered_tasks".

#### Example Response:
```python
# Parse the JSON response
if response.ok:
    filtered_tasks = response.json()["filtered_tasks"]
    # filtered_tasks will be a list of task dictionaries
    # Each task has the following structure:
    # {
    #     "id": "task-uuid",
    #     "title": "Task Title",
    #     "description": "Task Description",
    #     "priority": "high",
    #     "due_date": "2024-03-20",
    #     "completed": false,
    #     "created_at": "2024-03-19 10:30:00"
    # }
else:
    print("Error:", response.status_code)
```

### UML Sequence Diagram
The following sequence diagram illustrates the communication flow between your application and the Task Filter Service:

![UML Sequence Diagram](./uml_sequence_diagram.png)

### Error Handling
The service returns appropriate HTTP status codes:
- 200: Successful request
- 400: Invalid parameters
- 500: Server error

Error responses include a JSON object with an "error" key containing the error message.

Example error handling:
```python
response = requests.get("http://task_filter:5003/filter_tasks?priority=invalid")
if not response.ok:
    error_message = response.json().get("error", "Unknown error")
    print(f"Error: {error_message}")
```

## Inclusivity Heuristics Justification
### Heuristic 1: Explain Benefits of Features
The project explains the benefits of new and existing features clearly on each page, helping users understand how each feature can improve their task management experience.

### Heuristic 2: Explain Costs of Features
Each page transparently communicates any costs or tradeoffs associated with using features, allowing users to make informed decisions about their usage.

### Heuristic 3: Flexible Information Access
The "üìã View Tasks" page exemplifies this by providing customizable filters for priority, completion status, and due date, letting users control how much information they see.

### Heuristic 4: Maintain Familiar Features
The application maintains consistency through:
- Familiar color schemes across pages
- Consistent layout patterns
- Standard navigation elements

### Heuristic 5: Support Reversible Actions
Users can:
- Undo/redo actions via sidebar buttons on all pages
- Navigate backwards through pages
- Reverse any changes made to tasks

### Heuristic 6: Clear Task Pathways
The application provides clear navigation paths for all core functions:
- Adding tasks
- Viewing tasks
- Updating tasks
- Analyzing task data

### Heuristic 7: Multiple Approaches
The "üìù Add Task" page demonstrates this by offering:
- Quick add option (task name only)
- Detailed form (name, priority, due date, description)

### Heuristic 8: Mindful Feature Exploration
The "‚úÖ Mark Complete" page encourages thoughtful interaction by:
- Requiring confirmation before task completion
- Showing tasks due within 24 hours
- Providing clear feedback on actions


## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- **Docker:** Ensure Docker is installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
- **Docker Compose:** Comes bundled with Docker Desktop.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/eclinick/CS361-Project.git
   
    ```

2. **Build and Run the Services:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    This command will build the Docker images and start all the services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

  

3. **Access the Application:**
    - **Frontend Interface:** Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to access the Streamlit frontend.
    - **API Services:** Each service can be accessed via their respective ports as defined in the `docker-compose.yml`:
        - **Task Stats Service:** `http://localhost:5001`
        - **Reminder Service:** `http://localhost:5002`
        - **Task Filter Service:** `http://localhost:5003`
        - **Productivity Analysis Service:** `http://localhost:5004`

4. **Stopping the Services:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```

### Troubleshooting
- **Port Conflicts:** Ensure that the ports `8501`, `5001`, `5002`, `5003`, and `5004` are not being used by other applications.
- **Docker Permissions:** If you encounter permission issues, ensure that your user has the necessary permissions to run Docker commands.
