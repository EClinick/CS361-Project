# Task Management API

This project is a microservices-based Task Management application that allows users to add, view, update, and analyze tasks. The application is built using Flask for backend services and Streamlit for the frontend interface. Docker Compose is used to orchestrate the services.

## Testing Task Filter Service

### Overview

This section outlines the testing strategy for the **Task Filter Service** (`task_filter.py`). The tests are designed to validate the functionality of filtering tasks and managing user filter preferences. The **Task Stats Service** (`task_stats.py`) is included to provide task data for the tests.

### Why include Task Stats Service in the testing of Task Filter Service?

Even though our primary goal is to test the **Task Filter Service**, the **Task Stats Service** plays a crucial role in providing the underlying task data. The **Task Filter Service** filters tasks based on criteria such as priority, completion status, and due date. To perform these filtering operations effectively, the service requires a set of tasks to work with. The **Task Stats Service** facilitates this by allowing the creation, retrieval, and deletion of tasks, which are used as test data for the filter tests. Without the **Task Stats Service**, setting up and tearing down test data would be cumbersome and less efficient.

### Test Cases Overview

#### 1. Service Validation
- **Purpose:** Ensure both services are running and accessible.
- **Endpoints Tested:**
  - `GET /filter_tasks` (Task Filter Service)
  - `GET /view_tasks` (Task Stats Service)

#### 2. Setting Up Test Data
- **Purpose:** Create test tasks to validate filtering capabilities.
- **Tasks Created:**
  - High Priority Complete Task
  - High Priority Pending Task  
  - Low Priority Pending Task

#### 3. Testing Filter Tasks Endpoint
- **Purpose:** Validate the filtering functionality based on different criteria.
- **Test Cases:**
  - Filter by Priority (High): Should return 2 high-priority tasks.
  - Filter Completed Tasks: Should return 1 completed task.
  - Filter by Due Date (Today): Should return 2 tasks due today.

#### 4. Testing Preferences Endpoints
- **Purpose:** Verify saving, retrieving, and clearing filter preferences.
- **Test Cases:**
  - Save Preferences: Save filter settings successfully.
  - Get Saved Preferences: Retrieve saved preferences accurately.
  - Clear Preferences: Clear all saved preferences.

#### 5. Cleaning Up Test Data
- **Purpose:** Remove all test tasks created during the setup phase.
- **Process:** Retrieve and delete all test tasks.

### Running the Tests

1. Ensure Services are Running:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

2. Navigate to the Test Directory:
   ```bash
   cd test
   ```

3. Run the Test Script:
   ```bash
   python testing_task_filter.py
   ```

4. Review the Output: The script will display the progress and results of each test case.

### Conclusion

The comprehensive testing of the **Task Filter Service** ensures that filtering functionalities and preference management operate as expected. Including the **Task Stats Service** in the testing process is crucial for managing the necessary task data, thereby facilitating accurate and reliable test outcomes.

<!-- ### Planned Microservices

## Inclusivity Heuristics Justification

‚Ä¢	How your design correctly reflects heuristic 1 (‚ÄúExplain (to users) the benefits of using new and existing features‚Äù): 

The project correctly reflects heuristic 1 by explaining the benefits of using new and existing features. This is shown on each page.

‚Ä¢	How your design correctly reflects heuristic 2 (‚ÄúExplain (to users) the costs of using new and existing features‚Äù): 

The project correctly reflects heuristic 2 by explaining the costs of using new and existing features. This is shown on each page.

‚Ä¢	How your design correctly reflects heuristic 3 (‚ÄúLet people gather as much information as they want, and no more than they want‚Äù): 

The project correctly reflects heuristic 3 by letting users gather as much information as they want, and no more than they want. This is shown on "üìã View Tasks" page, where users can filter the tasks by priority, completion status, and due date.


‚Ä¢	How your design correctly reflects heuristic 4 (‚ÄúKeep familiar features available‚Äù):

The project correctly reflects heuristic 4 by keeping familiar features available. This is shown on each page. The color scheme is consistent and the layout is familiar.


‚Ä¢	How your design correctly reflects heuristic 5 (‚ÄúMake undo/redo and backtracking available‚Äù):

The project correctly reflects heuristic 5 by making undo/redo and backtracking available. This is shown on each page. The user can undo and redo actions, and go back to previous pages. The redo and undo buttons are available on the sidebar for any page.

‚Ä¢	How your design correctly reflects heuristic 6 (‚ÄúProvide an explicit path through the task‚Äù): 

The project correctly reflects heuristic 6 by providing an explicit path through the task. This is shown on each page. The user can easily navigate through the pages to add, view, update, and analyze tasks.

‚Ä¢	How your design correctly reflects heuristic 7 (‚ÄúProvide ways to try out different approaches‚Äù):

The project correctly reflects heuristic 7 by providing ways to try out different approaches. This is shown on "üìù Add Task" page, where the user can "quick add" a task by just inputting the task name, or a more detailed form add where they input the task name, priority, due date, and description.

‚Ä¢	How your design correctly reflects heuristic 8 (‚ÄúEncourage tinkerers to tinker mindfully‚Äù): 

The project correctly reflects heuristic 8 by encouraging tinkerers to tinker mindfully. This is shown on "‚úÖ Mark Complete" page, where the user can mark a task as complete by clicking a checkbox, or a list of tasks that are due within the next day. Before they can complete a task, they are asked to confirm that they want to mark the task as complete. Which encourages them to think about the task before completing it.


## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- **Docker:** Ensure Docker is installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
- **Docker Compose:** Comes bundled with Docker Desktop.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/eclinick/CS361-Project.git
   
    ```

2. **Build and Run the Services:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    This command will build the Docker images and start all the services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

  

3. **Access the Application:**
    - **Frontend Interface:** Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to access the Streamlit frontend.
    - **API Services:** Each service can be accessed via their respective ports as defined in the `docker-compose.yml`:
        - **Task Stats Service:** `http://localhost:5001`
        - **Reminder Service:** `http://localhost:5002`
        - **Task Filter Service:** `http://localhost:5003`
        - **Productivity Analysis Service:** `http://localhost:5004`

4. **Stopping the Services:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```

### Troubleshooting
- **Port Conflicts:** Ensure that the ports `8501`, `5001`, `5002`, `5003`, and `5004` are not being used by other applications.
- **Docker Permissions:** If you encounter permission issues, ensure that your user has the necessary permissions to run Docker commands.

## Future Enhancements

<!-- - **Undo/Redo Functionality:** Implement undo and redo features to allow users to revert or reapply actions.
- **User Authentication:** Add user accounts to manage tasks across different users.
- **Enhanced UI/UX:** Improve the frontend interface with better designs and user interactions.
- **Notifications:** Implement email or push notifications for task reminders.
- **Database Integration:** Replace in-memory task storage with a persistent database like PostgreSQL or MongoDB.
- **User Data Service:** Fully implement the User Data Service to handle user registrations, logins, and profile management. -->
